# Boot screen components


There are two components to the firmware update boot screen: the OEM logo and the update text. This topic provides guidance about how to configure each of these components, and information about how these components are passed to the firmware in a firmware update capsules.

## OEM logo


The OEM logo in the firmware update boot screen must be the same logo which is displayed during the normal boot process. For firmware update boot screens the logo must be the same size, position and quality expected as is displayed during the normal boot process.

## Update text


The update text in the firmware update boot screen is a simple string that is designed to be quick to read and easy to understand. The text is rendered by the Windows bootloader. Once it determines that firmware updates are pending then the bootloader determines the locale of Windows and displays the localized text on the screen.

During the call into UpdateCapsule the bootloader will pass all firmware update capsules. In addition it will also pass in a Microsoft-defined *firmware update display* capsule that contains a bitmap of the text which is displayed and the location of the bitmap on the screen. The system firmware’s UpdateCapsule method must persist the capsule so that any time the screen is cleared or modified it can re-display the bitmap on the screen.

## Windows firmware update display capsule


When the Windows bootloader calls into the system firmware’s UpdateCapsule method, it passes in all firmware update capsules. Additionally it will pass in a Windows UX capsule. This capsule contains the bitmap of rendered, localized text which must be displayed on the screen. The following GUID is used to identify this capsule: {3b8c8162-188c-46a4-aec9-be43f1d65697}.

There is no guarantee of order the UX capsule will appear in the array of capsules. Do not rely on a specific index position to find the UX capsule. A best practice includes scanning the array looking for the UX capsule and processing it before processing remaining firmware capsules in the array.

It is important to note that there may be some scenarios where there will be no UX capsule. For example, there will be no UX capsule in the case of a headless server that has no display adapter. In such cases the firmware UpdateCapsule call can ignore the UX capsule requirement. However if the UX Capsule is present, then UpdateCapsule must process it according to the process described in this section.

The following table describes the firmware update display header for the UX capsule.

Note that unlike a capsule generated for the firmware update payload, the display capsule payload is not padded to be page-aligned. The display payload immediately follows the capsule header.

The firmware update display capsule describes a graphic that must be rendered during the duration of a firmware update. The graphic is initially rendered and display by Windows and handed off to the firmware as part of the same UpdateCapsule call containing the update payload(s) to the firmware. If the firmware resets the system or the video device, the firmware must redisplay the bitmap provided in the display capsule. If physical memory is not persisted across the reset, the firmware may have to save the bitmap to persistent storage to redisplay the bitmap after the reset. The details on how to save and restore the bitmap across a reset are implementation specific and are not discussed in this paper.

The firmware update display capsule is modeled off of the Boot Graphics Resource Table (BGRT) defined in ACPI 5.0. The BGRT defines a mechanism for system firmware to provide a graphic to an OS boot loader. While the two tables are similar, there are a couple of notable differences.

| BGRT                        | Firmware update display capsule                                                         | Reason                                                                                                                                                        |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pointer to Bitmap           | Embedding the bitmap allows the capsule to be saved and restored in a single operation. | 0                                                                                                                                                             |
| Does not contain video mode | Contains video mode                                                                     | Done to avoid requiring the firmware to query video mode during UpdateCapsule call.                                                                           |
| Contain a Status field      | Does not contain a Status field                                                         | The Status field of the BGRT describes whether the image is currently displayed on the screen. This is not applicable to the firmware update display capsule. |
