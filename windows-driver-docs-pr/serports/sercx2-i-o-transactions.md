# SerCx2 I/O Transactions


SerCx2 simplifies the handling of read ([**IRP\_MJ\_READ**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff546883)) and write ([**IRP\_MJ\_WRITE**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff546904)) requests for your serial controller driver. In response to a read or write request, SerCx2 issues one or more I/O transactions to the serial controller driver. From the driver's point of view, each transaction is a simple and complete I/O operation.

<td><p>SerCx2 handles a read or write request from a client by issuing one or more I/O transactions to the serial controller driver. This driver treats each transaction as a self-contained I/O operation that transfers data between the serial controller and the data buffer in the request.</p></td>

To start a PIO-receive transaction, SerCx2 calls the driver's [<em>EvtSerCx2PioReceiveReadBuffer</em>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn265214) event callback function and supplies a read buffer as a parameter.</p></td>
