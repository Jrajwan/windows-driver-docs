# Accessing a Device on a SerCx2-Managed Serial Port


SerCx2 and a serial controller driver jointly manage a serial port to which a peripheral device is permanently connected. To access a peripheral device on a SerCx2-managed serial port, your peripheral driver opens a logical connection to the serial port and obtains a file handle to represent this connection. Then the driver uses this handle to send I/O requests to the port.

<td><p>Typically, a serial port managed by SerCx2 is permanently connected to a peripheral device. This device is controlled by a peripheral driver that sends I/O requests to the serial port. These requests transfer data to and from the device, and configure the state of the serial port. I/O requests sent by the peripheral driver are jointly handled by SerCx2 and an associated serial controller driver.</p></td>

This FIFO provides hardware-controlled buffering of data received from the peripheral device that is connected to the serial port.
