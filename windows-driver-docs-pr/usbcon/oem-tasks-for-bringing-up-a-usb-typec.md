Describes Windows support for USB Type-C connector and tasks for OEMs who are building USB Type-C systems, including how to write drivers that manage different features of the connector.

A traditional USB connection uses a cable with a USB A and USB B connector on each end. The USB A connector always plugs in to the host side and the USB B connector connects the function side, which is a device (phone) or peripheral (mouse, keyboard). By using those connectors, you can only connect a host to a function; never a host to another host or a function to another function. The host is the power source provider and the function consumes power from the host.

The traditional configuration limits some scenarios. For example, if a mobile device wants to connect to a peripheral, the device must act as the host and deliver power to the connected device.

The USB Type-C connector, introduced by the USB-IF, defined in the USB 3.1 specification, addresses those limitations. Windows 10 introduces native support for those features.

Such systems typically have a dual-role controller that can swap the USB role from host to function. It has Display-Out module that allows video signal to be transmitted over USB. Optionally it can support BC1.2 charger detection.</p>

<p>Use this flow chart to determine a solution for your USB Type-C system. </p>

<li><p>For a system that does not implement a PD state machine, implement a client driver to the UcmTcpciCx class extension. </p>

[Write a USB Type-C port controller driver](write-a-usb-type-c-port-controller-driver.md)

</li>

<li>For systems that implement the PD state machines in hardware or firmware and support USB Type-C Connector System Software Interface (UCSI) over ACPI, load the Microsoft provided in-box driver, UcmUcsi.sys. 

See [UCSI driver](ucsi.md).</li>

<li><p>For systems that implement the PD state machines in hardware or firmware, but either do not support UCSI, or support UCSI but require a transport other than ACPI, write a client driver for the UcmCx class extension.</p>

<p>For systems that implement UCSI but require a transport other than ACPI, Microsoft provides a skeleton UcmCx client driver based on the inbox UCSI driver that can be modified to support a different transport. 

See [this sample template](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/tree/master/usb/UcmCxUcsi). </p>

<li>USB Function driver bring-up is only required if you support USB Function mode. If you previously implemented a USB Function driver for a USB micro-B connector, describe the appropriate connectors as USB Type-C in the ACPI tables for the USB Function driver to continue working. 

For more information, see [instructions about writing a USB Function driver.](developing-windows-drivers-for-usb-function-controllers.md).
</li>
<li>USB Role-Switch driver bring-up is only required for devices that have a Dual Role controller that assumes both Host and Function roles. To bring-up the USB Role-Switch driver, you need to modify the ACPI tables to enable the Microsoft in-box USB role-switch driver. 

For more information, see the [guidance for bringing up the USB Role Switch Driver](dual-role-controller-bringup-for-a-usb-type-c-system.md).</li>

<li><p>A USB Connector Manager Driver is required for Windows to manage the USB Type-C ports on a system. The bring-up tasks for a USB Connector Manager driver depend on the driver that you choose for the USB Type-C ports: The Microsoft in-box UCSI (UcmUcsi.sys) driver, a UcmCx client driver, or a UcmTcpciCx client driver. For more information, see the links in the preceding section that describe how to choose the right solution for your USB Type-C system.</p></li>
