<td><p>To get the most benefit from the [Device Fundamental tests](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows-drivers/develop/how_to_select_and_configure_the_device_fundamental_tests), your device should have a Simple I/O plug-in that can perform simple I/O to your device. This can be one of the default Simple I/O plugs that come with WDTF or one that you wrote. To see if your device type is supported and to determine if there are specific requirements for testing, refer to [Provided WDTF Simple I/O plug-ins](provided-wdtf-simpleio-plug-ins.md).</p></td>
