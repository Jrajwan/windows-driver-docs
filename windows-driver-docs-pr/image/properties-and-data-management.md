# Properties and Data Management





WIA minidrivers define the characteristics that describe the still image device and the data that the device produces or stores. This section describes how the driver creates a logical representation of the device and its settings, the data that the device stores or produces, and the characteristics of that data.

This section contains the following topics:

[Device Properties](device-properties.md)

[Driver Items](driver-items.md)
