# PostScanInstructions.DocumentRootName


The **DocumentRootName** element contains a root document name for a post-scan job to use as the basis for the file names that the job generates for the documents (image files) that it processes.

The post-scan job generates file names for the documents that it receives from the WSD scan device. The scan server creates a file name by concatenating the document root name with additional identifying information. The additional information might include the date, the time, and the user name of the account that created the job. For more information about user names, see **JobOriginatingUserName**.

This element has no sub-elements.
