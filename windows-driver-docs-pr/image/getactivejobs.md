# GetActiveJobs


The **GetActiveJobs** operation requests a summary listing of the scan jobs that are currently active on a scanner. The listing contains such information as the **JobId**, **JobOriginatingUserName**, and the **JobName** of each active scan job. To retrieve more detailed information about a job, use the **GetJobElements** operation.

The **GetActiveJobs** operation supports the following sub-elements:

[**GetActiveJobsRequest**](getactivejobsrequest.md)

[**GetActiveJobsResponse**](getactivejobsresponse.md)
