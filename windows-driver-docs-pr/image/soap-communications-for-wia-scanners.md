# SOAP Communications for WIA Scanners


A WIA driver that uses WSD communicates with the scanner device by using Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), which is a protocol that forms the foundation layer of the web services stack.

The driver must use the Function Discovery service to initialize SOAP communications with the device.

This section contains the following topics:

[Obtaining a Function Instance Object](obtaining-a-function-instance-object.md)

[Reading Device Metadata](reading-device-metadata.md)
