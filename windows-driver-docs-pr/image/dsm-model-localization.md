# DSM Model Localization


A DSM Device is assumed to be operating within the locale of the user. No other localization mechanism is defined for the DSM Device. The control point is expected to localize the well-known string values to the locale of its user. The control point is expected to convert the enumerated integer values to human-readable string values in the locale of the user.
