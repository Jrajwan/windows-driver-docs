# Automatically Generated Object Names





If the **Filename** field of the ObjectInfo dataset is blank, the Microsoft PTP WIA minidriver creates a name based on the ObjectFormat and ObjectHandle fields. For example, an image with an ObjectHandle value of 5 is called Image5 on the English version of Windows.
