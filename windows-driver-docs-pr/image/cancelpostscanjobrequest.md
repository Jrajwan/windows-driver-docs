# CancelPostScanJobRequest


The **CancelPostScanJobRequest** element is a request to cancel a post-scan job.

To cancel a post-scan job, a DSM device sends a message that contains a **CancelPostScanJobRequest** element to the DSM scan server. The scan server responds with a message that contains a **CancelPostScanJobResponse** element.

A **CancelPostScanJobRequest** contains a **JobToken** child element that identifies the post-scan job being canceled. The same user who previously submitted the **CreatePostScanJob** request that created the job must submit the job-cancellation request, and the job identifier specified by the **JobToken** element must be the same as in the earlier request. The scan server performs a *best effort* cancellation and does not delete any files that the filters have already processed in the post-scan job.

The **CancelPostScanJobRequest** element supports the following sub-element:

[CancelPostScanJobRequest.JobToken](cancelpostscanjobrequest-jobtoken.md)

For an example of how the **CancelPostScanJobRequest** element can be used in a SOAP message from a DSM device, see [CancelPostScanJobRequest Example](cancelpostscanjobrequest-example.md).
