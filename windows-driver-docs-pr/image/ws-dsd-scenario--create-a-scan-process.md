# WS-DSD Scenario: Create a Scan Process


An administrator would like to create a scan process from a control point for a specific set of users. The scan process includes the scan ticket and post-scan instructions. The administrator interacts with the user interface provided by a client application on the control point to select and configure the parameters that the DSM Device will use when scanning. The client application saves the parameters as a scan ticket. The control point validates the scan ticket on behalf of the administrator to determine whether the scan ticket is valid for a given DSM Device. The control point informs the administrator that the scan ticket is valid and associates the scan ticket and the post-scan instructions together to create a scan process. The control point then stores the complete scan process in a directory service.
