# ValidateScanTicket


The **ValidateScanTicket** element enables a client application to query the scanner to determine if the settings for a future scan operation are valid. This operation can be used to validate changes and combinations of settings.

The **ValidateScanTicket** operation supports the following sub-elements:

[ValidateScanTicketRequest](validatescanticketrequest.md)

[ValidateScanTicketResponse](validatescanticketresponse.md)
