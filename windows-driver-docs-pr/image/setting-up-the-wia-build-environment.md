# Setting Up the WIA Build Environment





This section describes the files required to build Microsoft WIA minidrivers and microdrivers, and provides links to the general topics on how to build a driver. You can build a project from the command line using the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) build tools, or from within the Microsoft Visual Studio environment that comes with Microsoft Visual C++.

[Building a WIA Minidriver](building-a-wia-minidriver.md)

[Building a WIA Microdriver](building-a-wia-microdriver.md)

For details about how to build a driver in the WDK environment, see [Tools for Building Drivers](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff552950).
