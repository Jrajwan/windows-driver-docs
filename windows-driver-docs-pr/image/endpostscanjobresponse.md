# EndPostScanJobResponse


The **EndPostScanJobResponse** element is a response to a request from a client to end a post-scan job.

A DSM scan server sends a message that contains an **EndPostScanJobResponse** element in response to an [EndPostScanJobRequest](endpostscanjobrequest.md) message received from a DSM device. The message from the scan server acknowledges receipt of the request from the device to end a post-scan job.

If the requested operation fails, the scan server sends the device an error message instead of an **EndPostScanJobResponse** message. For more information about error messages, see [WS-DSP Operation Error Reporting](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540619).

The **EndPostScanJobResponse** element does not have any child elements.

For an example of using the **EndPostScanJobResponse** element, see [EndPostScanJobResponse Example](endpostscanjobresponse-example.md).
