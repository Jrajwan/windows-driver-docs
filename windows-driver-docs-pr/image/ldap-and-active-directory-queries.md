# LDAP and Active Directory Queries


When the scanner user walks up to the device and enters their credentials on the logon screen, the device must get the list of scan processes (PSPs) from the Active Directory (AD) server. This will require the use of Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP).

To get PSPs from AD, do the following steps:

1.  [LDAP Connect](ldap-connect.md)

2.  [LDAP Bind](ldap-bind.md)

3.  [LDAP Search for PSPs](ldap-search-for-psps.md)

For more information about LDAP, see [Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Client](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=154077).
