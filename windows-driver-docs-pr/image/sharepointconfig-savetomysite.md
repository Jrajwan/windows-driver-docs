# SharePointConfig.SaveToMySite


The **SaveToMySite** contains a Boolean value that indicates whether the scanned images should be saved to the MySite SharePoint document library of the user who initiated the PostScan job. The value **true** indicates the MySite document library of the user who submitted PostScan job should be added to the list of destination SharePoint document libraries. The value **false** indicates the list of destination SharePoint document libraries should not be changed.

The **SaveToMySite** element is an optional child element of a **SharePointConfig** element. By default if the **SaveToMySite** element is omitted, the list of destination SharePoint document libraries should not be changed.

This element has no sub-elements.
