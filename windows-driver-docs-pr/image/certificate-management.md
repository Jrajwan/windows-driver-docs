# Certificate Management


DSM supports:

[Strong Authentication](strong-authentication.md)

[Weak Authentication](weak-authentication.md)

For either mode the device will need to implement server authentication so that devices trust the certificate sent from the scan server. To enable strong authentication, in addition to implementing server authentication, the device will need to implement client authentication using user certificates.
