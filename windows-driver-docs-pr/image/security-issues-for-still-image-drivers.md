# Security Issues for Still Image Drivers

It is important to remember that a user-mode minidriver can be called either from an application through an image acquisition API, or from the still image event monitor, which is implemented as a Windows service. There are security implications associated with these multiple calling sources. For example, if a user-mode minidriver creates a mutex using the default security descriptor (by specifying a **NULL** security descriptor), one mutex cannot be shared between an instance of the minidriver called from the event monitor and one called from an image acquisition API.
