# User Interfaces


The DSM device must implement user interfaces to enable the following actions by the user:

-   Allow the user to enter access credentials which the DSM Device uses to authenticate to the domain.

-   Select from a list of scan processes retrieved from Active Directory that the user is authorized to use.

In addition, you should enter a list of email addresses if a scan process allows it.
