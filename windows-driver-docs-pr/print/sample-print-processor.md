# Sample Print Processor





Source code for Genprint.dll, a sample print processor that accepts [EMF data](emf-data-type.md), [RAW data](raw-data-type.md), and [TEXT data](text-data-type.md) as input, is included in the Windows Driver Kit (WDK). The code is located in the \\Src\\Print\\Genprint subdirectory in the WDK.

**Note**   When you compile this print processor, set the Unicode flag with \#define UNICODE.
