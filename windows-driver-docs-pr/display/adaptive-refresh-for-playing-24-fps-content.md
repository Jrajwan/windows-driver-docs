# Adaptive refresh for playing 24 fps video content


When Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) 1.3 and later drivers play 24 frame per second (fps) video content on 60-Hz monitors, they must implement 48-Hz adaptive refresh to conserve power. In this scenario the monitor switches from 60 Hz to a 48-Hz refresh rate to play back 24-fps video content.

These are the device driver interfaces (DDIs) that WDDM 1.3 and later drivers must implement for 24-fps playback:
