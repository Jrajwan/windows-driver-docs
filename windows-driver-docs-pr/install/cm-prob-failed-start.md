# CM_PROB_FAILED_START

This function is reserved for system use.





The device failed to start.

### Error Code

10

### Display Message (Windows 2000 and later versions of Windows)

If the device's hardware key contains a "FailReasonString" value, the value string is displayed as the error message. (A driver or enumerator supplies this registry string value.) If the hardware key does not contain a "FailReasonString" value, the following generic error message is displayed:

"This device cannot start. (Code 10)"

"Try upgrading the device drivers for this device."

### Recommended Resolution (Windows 2000 and later versions of Windows)

Select **Update Driver**, which starts the Hardware Update wizard.

This error code is set when one of the drivers in the device's driver stack fails IRP_MN_START_DEVICE. If there are many drivers in the stack, it can be difficult to determine the one that failed.
