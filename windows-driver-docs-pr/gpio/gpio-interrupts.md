# GPIO Interrupts


Some general-purpose I/O (GPIO) controller devices can configure their GPIO pins to function as interrupt request inputs. These interrupt request inputs are driven by peripheral devices that are physically connected to the GPIO pins. The drivers for these GPIO controllers can enable, disable, mask, unmask, and clear interrupt requests on individual GPIO pins.

Support for GPIO interrupts is optional. The GPIO framework extension (GpioClx) does not require GPIO controllers to support GPIO interrupts.

<td><p>GPIO interrupt handling is inherently a two-stage process. The interrupt from the general-purpose I/O (GPIO) controller, which causes the GPIO framework extension (GpioClx) interrupt service routine (ISR) to run, is called the <em>primary interrupt</em>. This ISR maps the interrupting GPIO pin to a global system interrupt (GSI), and passes this GSI to the hardware abstraction layer (HAL). The HAL generates a <em>secondary interrupt</em> to run a second ISR that is logically connected to the GPIO pin through this GSI. This process is shown in the diagram in [GPIO Driver Support Overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh439512#gpio-block-diagram).</p></td>

<td><p>As an option, the driver for a general-purpose I/O (GPIO) controller can provide support for GPIO interrupts. To support GPIO interrupts, a GPIO controller driver implements a set of callback functions to manage these interrupts. The driver includes pointers to these callback functions in the registration packet that the driver supplies when it registers itself as a client of GPIO framework extension (GpioClx).</p></td>

Driver code that runs at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL can call these methods to synchronize to the interrupt service routine (ISR) in GpioClx. GpioClx dedicates a separate interrupt lock to each bank of pins in the GPIO controller.</p></td>
