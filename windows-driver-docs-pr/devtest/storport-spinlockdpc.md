# SpinLockDpc rule (storport)


This rule verifies that a call to **KeAcquireSpinLockRaiseToDpc** is promptly followed by a call to **KeReleaseSpinlock**. If a driver calls **KeAcquireSpinLock** or **KeAcquireSpinLockRaiseToDpc** again prior to releasing the lock, it fails the rule. In addition, before exiting the dispatch or cancel routine, the driver must release the spin lock.
