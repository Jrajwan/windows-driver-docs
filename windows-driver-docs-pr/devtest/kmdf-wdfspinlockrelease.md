# WdfSpinlockRelease rule (kmdf)


The **WdfSpinlockRelease** rule specifies that calls to [**WdfSpinLockAcquire**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550040) and **WdfSpinlockRelease** are used in a balanced way within a KMDF event callback function. When the KMDF event callback function returns, the driver should not hold the framework spin lock object that was obtained by a previous call to **WdfSpinLockAcquire**.
