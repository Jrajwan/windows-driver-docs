# ReqSendWhileSpinlock rule (kmdf)


The **ReqSendWhileSpinlock** rule specifies that no requests are sent while the driver holds a spinlock.

If the driver sends any requests while it holds a spinlock, it could cause a deadlock or clash with the lower driver that receives the requests, if the lower driver also attempts to acquire a lock or access shared resources.
