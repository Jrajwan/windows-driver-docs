**To select the Locking rule set**

1.  Select your driver project (.vcxProj) in Microsoft Visual Studio. From the **Driver** menu, click **Launch Static Driver Verifier…**.

2.  Click the **Rules** tab. Under **Rule Sets**, select **Locking**.

    To select the default rule set from a Visual Studio developer command prompt window, specify **Locking.sdv** with the **/check** option. For example:

    ```
    msbuild /t:sdv /p:Inputs="/check:Locking.sdv" mydriver.VcxProj /p:Configuration="Win8 Release" /p:Platform=Win32
    ```
