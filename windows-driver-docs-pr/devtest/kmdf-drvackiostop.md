# DrvAckIoStop rule (kmdf)


The **DrvAckIoStop** rule verifies that the driver is aware of pending requests while its power-managed queue is getting powered-down and the driver acknowledges, completes, or cancels the pending requests accordingly. In the case of self-managed I/O requests, the driver should also correctly handle these requests from its [*EvtDeviceSelfManagedIoSuspend*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540907) function. A driver that fails to handle these requests during a power-down would cause [**Bug Check 0x9F: DRIVER\_POWER\_STATE\_FAILURE**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559329).

In some circumstances it might be appropriate to to suppress this warning. If the driver does not hold on to the requests, or does not forward them to other drivers, and if the driver completes the requests directly in the queue's handlers, you can use the **\_\_analysis\_assume** function to suppress the warning. For more information, see [Using the \_analysis\_assume Function to Suppress False Defects](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556059) and [**How to: Specify Additional Code Information by Using \_\_analysis\_assume**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ms404702).
