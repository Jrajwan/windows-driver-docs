# WDF Verifier Control Application


The Windows Driver Frameworks (WDF) Verifier control application (WdfVerifier.exe) is a tool for debugging Kernel-Mode Driver Framework (KMDF) and User-Mode Driver Framework (UMDF) drivers. You can use the tool for a quick assessment of drivers on a machine, and to make changes to their debugger settings.

This documentation describes options found in the version of the application that ships as part of Windows Driver Kit (WDK) 8.1.

**Important**  To use WDF Verifier, you must have administrative privileges on the computer.

 

### <span id="wdf_verifier_features"></span><span id="WDF_VERIFIER_FEATURES"></span>What can I do with it?

-   Get quick information about all WDF drivers on a computer. You can organize the list by driver or by device.
-   Manage registry settings for debugging WDF drivers.
-   View UMDF driver host processes and drivers they host.
-   Manage diagnostic output.
-   Start user-mode debugging sessions, either manually or automatically.
