# StorPortSpinLock3 rule (storport)


The **StorPortSpinLock3** rule verifies the lock acquisition hierarchy that is described in the documentation for the [**StorPortAcquireSpinLock**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567025) routine.

Storport miniport drivers must ensure that they do not attempt to acquire a lock that is already held or acquire locks in an incorrect order. Either of these mistakes will result in system deadlock.
