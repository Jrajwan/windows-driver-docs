# SpinlockRelease rule (kmdf)


The **SpinlockRelease** rule specifies that calls to [**KeAcquireSpinLock**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551917), [**KeAcquireSpinLockRaiseToDpc**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551928), and [**KeReleaseSpinLock**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff553145) are used in a balanced way within a KMDF callback. At the end of any KMDF callback routine, the driver should not hold the spin lock.
