# Init\_RegisterInterrupt rule (ndis)


The Init\_RegisterInterrupt rule specifies that the registration of interrupts, which usually happens during initialization, must be undone if something goes wrong in the initialization process or during the halting of the miniport driver.

If **NdisMRegisterInterruptEx** is called at least one time during **MiniportInitializeEx**, the **NdisMDeregisterInterruptEx** function must be called at least one time in **MiniportHaltEx**.
