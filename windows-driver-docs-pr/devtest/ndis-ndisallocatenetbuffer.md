# NdisAllocateNetBuffer rule (ndis)


The **NdisAllocateNetBuffer** rule specifies that [**NdisAllocateNetBuffer**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff561607) and [**NdisFreeNetBuffer**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff562582) are called in alternate order. The ultimate goal is to make sure all instances of [**NET\_BUFFER**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff568376) are freed when [*MiniportHaltEx*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559388) ends.

The rule uses three different states. The state changes when a [**NET\_BUFFER**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff568376) is allocated or freed. If a **NET\_BUFFER** is still allocated when the [*MiniportHaltEx*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559388) exits, the rule reports the defect.
