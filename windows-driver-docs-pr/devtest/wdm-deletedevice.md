# DeleteDevice rule (wdm)


The **DeleteDevice** rule specifies that drivers should not rely on the I/O Manager or PnP Manager to keep the DeviceObject alive after a call to [**IoDeleteDevice**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549083).

Drivers should call [**IoDeleteDevice**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549083) after the lower driver has returned. This is the recommended behavior. This rule applies to FDO and FIDO drivers.

When handling an [**IRP\_MN\_REMOVE\_DEVICE**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551738) request, the driver should only call [**IoDeleteDevice**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549083) after [**IoCallDriver**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548336) or [**PoCallDriver**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559654) have returned.
