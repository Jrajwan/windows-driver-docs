# ReqMarkCancelableSend rule (kmdf)


The **ReqMarkCancelableSend** rule specifies that requests forwarded by the driver are not marked as cancelable by calling [**WdfRequestMarkCancelable**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549983).

To mark the request as cancelable, the driver must own the request. When the request is sent to another driver, the previous driver no longer has ownership and must call [**WdfRequestUnmarkCancelable**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550035) on the request if it was previously marked cancelable.
