# Init\_RegisterSG rule (ndis)


The Init\_RegisterSG rule specifies that the registration of the scatter-gather list (SG), which usually happens during initialization, must be undone if something goes wrong in the initialization process or during the halting of the miniport driver.

If **NdisMRegisterScatterGatherDma** is called at least one time during **MiniportInitializeEx**, the **NdisMDeregisterScatterGatherDma** function should be called at least one time in **MiniportHaltEx**.
