# CompleteRequest rule (wdm)


The **CompleteRequest** rule verifies that the [**IoCompleteRequest**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548343) routine is not called after a completion routine runs and that it does not return STATUS\_MORE\_PROCESSING\_REQUIRED.

This rule reports a defect if:

-   The driver calls [**IoCompleteRequest**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548343) when the driver does not own the request.

-   The driver fails to call [**IoCompleteRequest**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548343) when completion is required.
