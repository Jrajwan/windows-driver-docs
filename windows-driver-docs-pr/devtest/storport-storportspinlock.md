# StorPortSpinLock rule (storport)


This rule verifies that locks that are acquired via **StorPortAcquireSpinLock** are promptly released via **StorPortReleaseSpinLock**. The miniport driver fails the rule if it attempts to acquire a lock that it had already acquired, or if it attempts to release a lock that it had not acquired. In addition, at the end of the dispatch or cancel routine, the driver should not hold any spin locks.
