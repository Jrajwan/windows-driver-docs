# WdfWaitlockRelease rule (kmdf)


The **WdfWaitlockRelease** rule specifies that calls to [**WdfWaitLockAcquire**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551168) and [**WdfWaitLockRelease**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551173) are used in a balanced way within a KMDF event callback function. When the KMDF event callback function returns, the driver should not hold the framework spin lock object that was obtained by a previous call to **WdfWaitLockAcquire**.
