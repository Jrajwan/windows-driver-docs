# OID_GEN_CO_TRANSMIT_QUEUE_LENGTH

The OID_GEN_CO_TRANSMIT_QUEUE_LENGTH OID specifies the number of PDUs currently queued for transmission, whether on the NIC or in a driver-internal queue. The number returned is always the total number of PDUs currently queued, which can include unsubmitted send requests queued in the NDIS library.
