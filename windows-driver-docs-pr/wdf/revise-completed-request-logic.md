# Revise Code That Handles Completed Requests


Windows Driver Frameworks (WDF) provides three methods that complete I/O requests:

-   [**WdfRequestComplete**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549945)
-   [**WdfRequestCompleteWithInformation**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549948)
-   [**WdfRequestCompleteWithPriorityBoost**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549949) (KMDF only)

For information about using these methods, see [Completing I/O Requests](completing-i-o-requests.md).
