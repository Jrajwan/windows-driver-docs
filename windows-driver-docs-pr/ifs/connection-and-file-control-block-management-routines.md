# Connection and File Control Block Management Routines


The connection and file control block management routines are used by RDBSS to manage structures used to represent connections and file control blocks.

RDBSS provides the following routines for connection and file control block management that can be used by network mini-redirector drivers:

<tr class="header">

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p>[<strong>RxCreateNetFcb</strong>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554356)</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>This routine allocates, initializes, and inserts a new FCB structure into the in-memory data structures for a NET_ROOT structure on which this FCB is being opened. The structure allocated has space for a SRV_OPEN and an FOBX structure. This routine is used internally by RDBSS and should not be used by network mini-redirectors.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><p>[<strong>RxCreateNetFobx</strong>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554358)</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>This routine allocates, initializes, and inserts a new file object extension (FOBX) structure. Network mini-redirectors should call this routine to create an FOBX at the end of a successful create operation.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p>[<strong>RxCreateNetRoot</strong>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554366)</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>This routine builds a node that represents a NET_ROOT structure and inserts the name into the net name table on the associated device object. This routine is used internally by RDBSS and should not be used by network mini-redirectors.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><p>[<strong>RxCreateSrvCall</strong>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554370)</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>This routine builds a node that represents a server call context and inserts the name into the net name table maintained by RDBSS. This routine is used internally by RDBSS and should not be used by network mini-redirectors.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p>[<strong>RxCreateSrvOpen</strong>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554376)</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>This routine allocates, initializes, and inserts a new SRV_OPEN structure into the in-memory data structures used by RDBSS. If a new structure must be allocated, it has space for an FOBX structure. This routine is used internally by RDBSS and should not be used by network mini-redirectors.</p></td>

<td align="left"><p>[<strong>RxFinalizeConnection</strong>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554409)</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>This routine deletes a connection to a share. Any files open on the connection are closed depending on the level of force specified. The network mini-redirector might choose to keep the transport connection open for performance reasons, unless some option is specified to force a close of the connection.</p></td>

Note that a number of macros are also defined that provide wrappers around the [**RxReference**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554688) and [**RxDeference**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554388) routines for debugging. For more information about these macros, see [Diagnostics and Debugging](diagnostics-and-debugging.md).
