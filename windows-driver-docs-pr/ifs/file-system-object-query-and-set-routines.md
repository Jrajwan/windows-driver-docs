# File System Object Query and Set Routines


A number of routines that can be implemented by a network mini-redirector are for query and set operations on file system objects. RDBSS issues most of these calls in response to receiving an IRP to query or set information on a file object. So there is a direct correspondence between the IRP that RDBSS receives and the MRx query or set operation that RDBSS calls.

The following table lists the routines that can be implemented by a network mini-redirector for file system object query and set operations.
