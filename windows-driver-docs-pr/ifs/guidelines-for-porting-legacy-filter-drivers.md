# Guidelines for Porting Legacy Filter Drivers


## <span id="ddk_when_the_filterunloadcallback_routine_is_called_if"></span><span id="DDK_WHEN_THE_FILTERUNLOADCALLBACK_ROUTINE_IS_CALLED_IF"></span>


Developers are encouraged to port legacy filter drivers to the filter manager model to obtain better functionality for their filter drivers and improve system reliability. Experienced developers should find it relatively easy to port a legacy filter driver to a minifilter driver. Filter driver developers at Microsoft recommend the following approach:

-   Start with a reliable regression test suite to verify behavior between the legacy filter driver and the ported minifilter driver.

-   Create a minifilter driver shell and systematically move functionality from the legacy filter driver to the minifilter driver. For example, get attachment working and then port one operation at a time, testing after each operation.

-   Change user-mode/kernel-mode communication last, so you can use existing tools to test the minifilter driver.

-   Compile with PREfast and test with the Filter Verifier I/O verification option in Driver Verifier enabled.

During the porting process, you should review all legacy filter driver code to take full advantage of filter manager capabilities. In particular, keep the following in mind:

-   IRP-based I/O and fast I/O operations can come through the same operation when appropriate, which helps reduce duplication of code.

-   When registering for operations, a minifilter driver can explicitly choose to ignore all paging I/O and cached I/O, which eliminates the need for code to check these.

-   Instance notifications greatly simplify attach/detach logic.

-   Register only for operations that your minifilter driver must handle; you can ignore everything else.

-   Take advantage of filter manager context and name management support.

-   Take advantage of filter manager support for issuing non-recursive I/O.

-   Unlike legacy filter drivers, minifilter drivers cannot rely on local variables to maintain context from preoperation processing to postoperation processing. Consider allocating a lookaside list to store operation state.

-   Be sure to release references when finished with a name or context.

-   Completion ports in user mode add a powerful technique for building queues. You will probably need only a single connection to a single named port.

The following table lists common operations in a legacy filter driver and how they map to the filter manager model.
