# Introduction to WMI





By making your driver a WMI provider, you can:

-   Make custom data available to WMI consumers.

-   Permit WMI consumers to configure a device through a standard interface rather than a custom control panel application.

-   Notify WMI consumers of driver-defined events without requiring the consumer to poll or send IRPs.

-   Reduce driver overhead by collecting and sending only requested data to a single destination.

-   Annotate data and event blocks with descriptive driver-defined class names and optional descriptions that WMI clients can then enumerate and display to users.
