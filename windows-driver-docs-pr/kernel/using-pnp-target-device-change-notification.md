# Using PnP Target Device Change Notification





A driver registers for **EventCategoryTargetDeviceChange** notification on a device so the driver can be notified when the device is about to be removed. For example, if a driver opens a handle to a device, the driver should register for **EventCategoryTargetDeviceChange** notification on the device so the driver can close its handle when the PnP manager needs to remove the device.

Drivers can also use **EventCategoryTargetDeviceChange** notification for custom notification. (See [Using PnP Custom Notification](using-pnp-custom-notification.md).)

The following subsections discuss how to register for target device change notification and how to handle target device change events in a PnP notification callback routine:
