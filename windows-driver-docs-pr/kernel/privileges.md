# Privileges


A *privilege* is a right that is associated with a process, rather than an object. A typical example of a privilege is **SeBackupPrivilege**, which confers on a process the right to back up files on a disk.

A few routines check the privilege of the current process before completing an operation. If a driver routine is executed by the system process, then the operation always succeeds, but if the driver routine is executed by a user process that does not have the required privilege, then the operation can fail.

The following table lists some examples of privileges and routines that can require them to succeed.

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege</strong></p></td>
<td><p>[<strong>SeAccessCheck</strong>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563674)</p></td>

<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>SeSecurityPrivilege</strong></p></td>
<td><p>[<strong>SeAccessCheck</strong>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563674)</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

 

Most system routines do not perform any privilege checks.
