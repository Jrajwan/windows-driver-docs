# KSPROPERTY\_CAMERACONTROL\_EXTENDED\_FOCUSMODE


The KSPROPERTY\_CAMERACONTROL\_EXTENDED\_FOCUSMODE extended property is extended to support advanced focus scenarios as follows:

-   Focus unlock

-   Continuous focus and lock

-   Driver fallback control in the event of a focus search failure

-   Focus search on preconfigured regions

-   Predefined manual positions

The following new capability flags are defined in ksmedia\_phone.h for these new scenarios.

**KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_FOCUS\_CONTINUOUSLOCK**

When this flag is specified, it locks the continuous auto focus after ensuring focus convergence. The driver sends a completion event after the focus is locked. This flag can only be used when KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_FOCUS\_CONTINUOUS is specified. If KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_FOCUS\_CONTINUOUS is advertised by the driver, KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_FOCUS\_CONTINUOUSLOCK must also be supported.

**KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_FOCUS\_UNLOCK**

When this flag is specified, it unlocks the focus. For single focus, this releases focus and immediately moves the lens to a driver determined default position without initiating any focus search. For continuous auto focus, this releases focus and resumes continuous auto focus. The driver sends a completion event after focus is unlocked. If focus is not locked, the driver should accept this command and send a completion event immediately. This flag is not sticky and must not overwrite the focus mode which is defined as KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_VIDEOPROCFLAG\_AUTO, KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_FOCUS\_CONTINUOUS, KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_VIDEOPROCFLAG\_MANUAL.

**KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_FOCUS\_DRIVERFALLBACK\_OFF**

When this flag is specified, the driver must not decide a lens fallback position. If the focus search fails, the lens position must be kept at where the search ended. This flag can only be set along with the KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_VIDEOPROCFLAG\_AUTO flag or the KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_FOCUS\_CONTINUOUSLOCK flag.

**KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_FOCUS\_REGIONBASED**

When this flag is specified, the focus search is based on the regions preconfigured by ROI control. If no regions have been configured, focus search is based on the default region determined by the driver. This flag can only be set when KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_VIDEOPROCFLAG\_AUTO or KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_FOCUS\_CONTINUOUS is also specified at the same time.

**KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_VIDEOPROCFLAG\_AUTO**

This flag indicates that the focus is a single auto focus. The driver sends a completion event after the focus has converged. This flag is mutually exclusive of the KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_VIDEOPROCFLAG\_MANUAL and KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_FOCUS\_CONTINUOUS flags.

**KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_VIDEOPROCFLAG\_MANUAL**

This flag indicates that the focus is manual. The driver sends a completion event after the manual focus has completed. The lens position to use is determined by VideoProc.Value.ul if the DISTANCE\_XXX flag is not present. If the DISTANCE\_XXX flag is present, the DISTANCE\_XXX takes precedence over VideoProc.Value.ul and moves the lens to a predefined manual position as determined by the DISTANCE\_XXX flag.

**KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_VIDEOPROCFLAG\_LOCK**

This flag indicates that the focus is locked on the spot after it receives the LOCK command. The driver sends a completion event after the focus is locked. This flag must not overwrite the focus mode which is defined as KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_VIDEOPROCFLAG\_AUTO, KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_FOCUS\_CONTINUOUS, KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_VIDEOPROCFLAG\_MANUAL.

**KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_FOCUS\_CONTINUOUS**

This flag indicates that the focus is continuous. The driver must accept this command and complete the asynchronous operation immediately. This flag is mutually exclusive of the KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_VIDEOPROCFLAG\_MANUAL, KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_VIDEOPROCFLAG\_AUTO and LOCK flags. This mode is optional and may not be supported on all devices.

**KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_FOCUS\_RANGE\_MACRO\\NORMAL\\FULLRANGE**

The range serves only as a hint and the exact focal search range is up to driver. These flags can only be used with KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_VIDEOPROCFLAG\_AUTO and KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_FOCUS\_CONTINUOUS.

**KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_FOCUS\_DISTANCE\_NEAREST**

When this flag is specified with KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_VIDEOPROCFLAG\_MANUAL, the driver immediately moves the lens to a predefined nearest position and keeps the lens in that position.

**KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_FOCUS\_DISTANCE\_INFINITY**

When this flag is specified with KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_VIDEOPROCFLAG\_MANUAL, the driver immediately moves the lens to a predefined infinity position and keeps the lens in that position.

**KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_FOCUS\_DISTANCE\_HYPERFOCAL**

When this flag is specified with KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_VIDEOPROCFLAG\_MANUAL, the driver immediately moves the lens to a predefined hyper focal position and keeps the lens in that position.

The following capabilities are mandatory for Windows Phone 8.1 and later camera drivers.

-   KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_FOCUS\_UNLOCK

-   KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_FOCUS\_REGIONBASED

-   KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_FOCUS\_DRIVERFALLBACK\_OFF

-   KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_VIDEOPROCFLAG\_AUTO

-   KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_VIDEOPROCFLAG\_MANUAL

-   KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_VIDEOPROCFLAG\_LOCK

The descriptions and requirements for the [**KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_HEADER**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn925136) structure fields when using the KSPROPERTY\_CAMERACONTROL\_EXTENDED\_FOCUSMODE property are the same as the Windows 8.1 DDI.

The following table contains the descriptions and requirements for the KSCAMERA\_EXTENDEDPROP\_VIDEOPROCSETTING structure fields when using the KSPROPERTY\_CAMERACONTROL\_EXTENDED\_FOCUSMODE property. This structure is defined in ksmedia.h
